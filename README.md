## Must have
Make sure on your local machine, you have python 3.x.x installed, otherwise please download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Another important thing is `pip` to manage dependencies. Usually `pip` is included when installing python. Write `pip --version` on your command line to check if it is installed. If you get `pip: command not found`, check the pip installation guide [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

## Requirements
Do `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directories where `requirements.txt` is present before you start. This installs all the dependencies on your computer locally.
