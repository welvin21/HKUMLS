## Populate the datasets directory
Due to the extremely huge size of data, I don't think committing the training and test data is a good idea. So, you could download 
these data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data). Don't forget to put them inside the datasets directory.

## Requirements
Do `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the main directory before you start to install all the dependencies.
